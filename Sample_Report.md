# 📊 Sample Gap Analysis Report
**Audit Target:** BioScan AI Diagnostic System (Prototype v1)  
**Regulatory Framework:** EU AI Act, August 2026 Mandate  
**Audit Date:** Feb 5, 2026

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary
This audit identifies two critical (🔴 RED) compliance gaps in the BioScan AI technical summary. Without remediation, this system fails the mandatory "High-Risk AI" certification requirements for clinical deployment.

---

## 🔴 Gap 1: Article 10.3 (Data Representativeness)
**Requirement:** Training datasets must be relevant and statistically representative of the target population.
**Finding:** The system utilizes 50,000 photos from a public research dataset (Kaggle). 
**The Risk:** No statistical bridge or "Delta Analysis" was provided to prove these images represent the clinical demographics of the intended user environment (e.g., D.C. Metropolitan Area). This is a violation of the **Data Governance** mandate.



---

## 🔴 Gap 2: Article 14.4 (Human Oversight)
**Requirement:** Human oversight must allow for real-time intervention, override, or reversal of AI output.
**Finding:** Current oversight is limited to a "weekly dashboard review" by a physician.
**The Risk:** Retrospective review is not "Active Oversight." Under the EU AI Act, high-risk diagnostic tools must include a **"Real-Time Kill-Switch"** or an override mechanism during the diagnostic event itself.

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Remediation
1. **Bio-Statistical Validation:** Cross-reference public training data with local clinical census data to prove statistical representativeness.
2. **Interface Re-engineering:** Update the clinician dashboard to include a "Manual Override" flag that triggers an immediate HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) protocol.
